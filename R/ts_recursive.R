# Receives a group of Taxonomy IDs and the desired sample size m.
# Returns a sampled vector with maximized taxonomy diversity.
# Assumes that every input id is unique.
# May return repeated IDs if replacement == TRUE, to increase
# diversity when method == "diversity".
#
# Args:
# list containing fields:
#   taxlist$ts.params$taxon:  (char/integer) Taxon from which to start sampling
#                             children taxa.
#   taxlist$ts.params$m:      (integer) desired sample size.
#   taxlist$nodes:            (data.frame) pre-processed information from NCBI
#                             taxonomy.
#   taxlist$ts.params$countIDs: (numeric) count of taxnomoy IDs belonging to
#                             each taxon, created by get_taxonomy_counts()
#   replacement:              (logical) whether the algorithm allows to repeat
#                             IDs in order to maximize taxonomy diversity and to
#                             reach m IDs in the output.
#   randomize:                (char) whether the algorithm will choose IDs
#                             randomly or maintaining a balanced allocation (m_i
#                             differing by at most 1 if the maximum possible
#                             value wasn't reached).
#   method:                   (char) whether it favors balanced taxa
#                             representation ("balance") or maximized taxa
#                             representation ("diversity").
#   requireIDs:               (char) IDs that must appear in the output.
#
# Returns:
#   updated taxlist containing field:
#   outputIDs:                (vector) vector of IDs with maximized taxonomy
#                             balance or diversity.
